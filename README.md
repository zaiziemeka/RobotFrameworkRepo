About Robot Framework
- 
Robot Framework is a generic open source automation framework. It can be used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA).

Robot Framework is open and extensible and can be integrated with virtually any other tool to create powerful and flexible automation solutions. Being open source also means that Robot Framework is free to use without licensing costs.

Robot Framework has easy syntax, utilizing human-readable keywords. Its capabilities can be extended by libraries implemented with Python or Java. The framework has a rich ecosystem around it, consisting of libraries and tools that are developed as separate projects. 
 
 Setting up your environment
 -
You will need the following installed to ensure that Robot Framework is installed:
* An IDE (PyCharm or IntelliJ are suitable for Robot Framework)
* pip (this is the library used to install python libraries ) 
* Robot Framework (This will need to be installed via *pip3 install robot-framework*)
* Run Robot Framework TestCase
* Robot Framework Support
* IntelliBot @SeleniumLibrary Patched
* Chrome / FirefoxDriver Extension (this can be installed through the Zaizi Self-Service)


Running Robot Test Cases
- 
To run a Robot Framework test case, use the following command: 

`robot SampleTestCase1.robot`

(If you are in the same directory as the test case, you can just run the file, leaving out the directory from the command.) 

After running the test, you will be presented with a small report detailing what test cases passed, and where you can find the test run report.
